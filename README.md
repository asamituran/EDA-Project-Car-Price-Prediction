# EDA-Project-Car-Price-Prediction
Welcome to "*AutoScout Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project". Auto Scout data used in this project scraped from the Website of an online car trading company in 2022, and contains many features of 13 different car makes including 594 models. In this project, I had the opportunity to apply many commonly used algorithms for Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis by using a variety of Python libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and then I tried to get a clean dataset for my analysis and pretictive modelling in Machine Learning.
In this context, the project consists of 3 parts in general:

The first part is related to 'Data Cleaning'. It deals with Incorrect Headers, Incorrect Format, Anomalies, and Dropping useless columns.
The second part is related to 'Filling Data', in other words 'Imputation'. It deals with Missing Values. Categorical to numeric transformation, Encoding, is done as well.
The third part is related to 'Handling Outliers of Data' via Visualization libraries. So, some insights will be extracted.
